# Sors

## Setting
In the cyberpunk dystopia of Nox City you are a prominent mob boss in the constant struggle of underground shenanigans. The fierce competition with corrupt business politicals and rival gang leaders forces you to confront your opponents in 1-on-1 battles. An army of thugs, squalid creatures poised to carry out your illicit commands, are lurking in the streets of Nox city. Loyalty is a fleeting currency, and you know that as long as the payments keep flowing, their allegiance remains. Maybe the market's next-gen technology allows you to gain the edge over your opponents? Your choices echo in the neon-lit streets, where money rules, trust is fragile, and the line between victory and defeat razor-thin. The city's pulse beats with tension as you contemplate the next moves in this deadly game for control.

## Goal
The first who reduces thier opponent's life total to zero wins the game! You build a deck of cards during playtime to beat your opponent in creature based battle. To improve your deck, buy the right entities (creatures and technologies) as well as money cards and get rid of your bad initial cards. Enhance your limited resources with technologies and play your creatures to attack your opponent. Both players take actions simultaneously.

## How To
A turn of *Sors* has 9 phases, 3 of which are mandatory and 6 are optional. At the beginning of the turn, players choose 2 out of the 6 optional phases. Both players play ALL phases that ANY player picked, and everyone who picked it, gets a bonus during that phase as described below. Most phases are split into distinct steps, more to those detail later (TODO: Add ref). The phases are played in the following order, skipping the optional ones that NEITHER player has picked:
